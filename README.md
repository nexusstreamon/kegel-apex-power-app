# Apex Power - Kegel Exercise Timer Game App

## Overview

This is a fun and engaging game application designed to help users strengthen their pelvic floor muscles through a structured 12-week Kegel exercise program. The app incorporates a timer and game elements to make consistent training more enjoyable and trackable.
Its a simple application that stores the information in ~localstorage of modern browsers. The app intervals are scientifically researched and the data of the research can be downloaded and viewed in excel sheet format included in the research section of the repository.

## Key Features

* **Kegel Exercise Timer:** Provides precise timing for your Kegel exercises.
* **12-Week Program:** A guided program designed to gradually increase the intensity and duration of your exercises over 12 weeks.
* **Game-Like Interface:** Makes exercising more motivating and less monotonous.
* **Progress Tracking:** Allows users to monitor their progress throughout the program.
* **Research-Based:** The time interval training incorporated in this app is based on extensive online research.

## Research Basis

The time interval training methodology used in this application is informed by thorough online research on effective Kegel exercise techniques. The data supporting this research is available for review in an Excel sheet located in the `main` directory of this repository: [research_data.xlsx).

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the live app on GitHub Pages: [https://github.com/nexusstreamon).
2.  Start with Level 1 of the program.
3.  Follow the on-screen instructions and the timer for each exercise interval.

## Acknowledgements

* I used AI to gather the data from both ChatGPT and Gemini in tandem. The entire app was made using Canvas option availbale in Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. 

## Motivation and Final Thoughts

This repo is just made for hosting the app on github pages. I saw the lack of Kegal Exercises available online for free. Apps available in ios and google playstore are monitizedfor a basic timer and tracking. It does not need to be complicated or cost anything to access such health health resources.
