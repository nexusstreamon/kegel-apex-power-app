# Apex Power - Kegel Exercise Timer Game App

## Overview

This is a fun and engaging game application designed to help users strengthen their pelvic floor muscles through a structured 12-week Kegel exercise program. The app incorporates a timer and game elements to make consistent training more enjoyable and trackable.
Its a simple application that stores the information in ~localstorage of modern browsers. The app intervals are scientifically researched and the data of the research can be downloaded and viewed in excel sheet format included in the repository.

## How to Use. 
Navigation Flow:
After the onboarding. You are presented with the app interface. 

Clicking the Star button takes you to the new "All Levels" screen.
Clicking a level (e.g., "Level 1") on this screen takes you to the "Daily Progress" screen for that level.
The interface is pretty simple and intuitive.

## Acknowledgements

I used AI to gather the data from both ChatGPT and Gemini in tandem. The entire app was made using Canvas option availbale in Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. 

## Motivation and Final Thoughts

This repo is just made for hosting the app on github pages. 
I saw the lack of truly **Free Kegal Exercise Apps** or Online Free resources. Apps available in ios and google playstore are monitized - For a basic timer and tracking, It should not cost anything to access such health resources.

## Known Bugs

- There are many, inlcuding progress bar not moving when you move away from the tab. That is because the app uses the screen frames to estimate the progress of the bar. 
- Progress tracking is not seamless experience and user needs to click on **STAR Button**  and then the level and day number.
