## Acknowledgements

I used AI to gather the data from both ChatGPT and Gemini in tandem. The entire app was made using Canvas option availbale in Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. 

## Motivation and Final Thoughts

This repo is just made for hosting the app on github pages. 
I saw the lack of Free Kegal Exercise Apps or Online Free resources. Apps available in ios and google playstore are monitized - For a basic timer and tracking, It does not need to be complicated or cost anything to access such health resources.

## Known Bugs
